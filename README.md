## 🤖 AI Usage (Mandatory Section)

Development of KnowledgeAiAssist was significantly accelerated by **Antigravity (Powered by Gemini)**, which acted as a pair programmer for:
- **Architecture**: Designing the Service-Controller-Model pattern in the backend.
- **UI/UX**: Crafting a premium "crispy" design system with glassmorphism and magic gradients.
- **Logical Flow**: Generating complex Sequelize associations and AI service fallbacks.
- **Refactoring**: Transforming initial boilerplates into production-ready, modular code.

*Every line of AI-generated code was manually reviewed, refactored, and tested to ensure security standards and performance.*
